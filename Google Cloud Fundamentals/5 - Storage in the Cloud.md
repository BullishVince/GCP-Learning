The keys in object storage are in the form or URLs, which means object storage interacts well with web technologies.

Data commonly stored as objects include videos, pictures and audio recordings.

**Cloud Storage is well suited for serving website content, archival and disaster recovery, and direct download of files.**
Cloud Storage is primarily used whenever binary large-object (BLOB) storage is needed for online content such as videos, backup and archiving, or as a storage of intermediate results (such as in processing workflows).

### Cloud Storage Buckets
Cloud Storage files are organized into buckets.
A bucket needs a globally unique identifier and a specific geographic location for where it should be stored.
